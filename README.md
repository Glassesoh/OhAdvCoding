Contents/Log:
Human guided exploration (HuGE)

https://github.com/Improbable-AI/human-guided-exploration
Week 1: reading + annotating paper 
Looking through github
Testing github, getting used to it 

Week2: reading, annotating, taking notes
Going through source code
https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-023-00571-7 
https://news.mit.edu/2023/technique-enables-ai-edge-devices-keep-learning-over-time
Trying to use google colab with Github

Week3: Taking notes for project
Testing things on colab
data map visualization
Using some data that I have to do some data visualization
Using basemap 
Trying (and FAILING) to use PDE (partial differential equations) in code
pde main
Used some different values to see how DiffusionPDE works (it’s a new concept that I need to get used to)

Studying pde: https://medium.com/@gerald.hoxha94/partial-differential-equations-in-python-23ccd160c082 

Week4
Experimenting with MNIST to refresh AI+using AI memory
MNIST=handwriting database→ point of AI : read handwritten things
Maybe winter project could be improving upon mnist to read handwritten things and understanding them? 
Study transformers (“attention is all you need”, google) : https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762 
MNIST data is 11490434/11490434
